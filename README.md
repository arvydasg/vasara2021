## Purpose

A website that can be accessed by all my family members during our holiday this year.
Nice little project, combined many things that I was learning and made something useful. Great!

## Tools used

A page made with org mode (emacs) and exported to html using a prebuilt template.

* Emacs
* Org mode
* Html-theme - https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes

## Benefits of using .org file for quotes

* forever usable
* Easy to make a website
* Easy to sort into categories
* Easy to use search option

## Disadvantages

* not possible to generate quotes randomly with it
* note sure about site mod? huh? dont know what I mean
