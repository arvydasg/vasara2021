A website that can be accessed with all my family members during the time that
all of us gathered together.

A page made with org mode (emacs) and exported to html using a prebuilt template.

this one - https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes

Nice little project, combined many things that I was learning and made something useful. Great!

## Benefits of using .org file for quotes

* forever usable
* Easy to make a website
* Easy to sort into categories
* Easy to use search option

## disadvantages

* not possible to generate quotes randomly with it
* note sure about site mod? huh? dont know what I meant.
